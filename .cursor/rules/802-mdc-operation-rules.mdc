# MDC File Operation Rules

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context

- Apply when needing to create or modify .mdc files in .cursor/rules directory
- Apply when working with cursor rules that require modifications
- Apply when encountering permission restrictions in .cursor/rules directory

## Requirements

- Never attempt to directly create or edit .mdc files in the .cursor/rules directory due to permission restrictions
- Assume the \_\_tmp directory already exists - do not create it unnecessarily
- Always use the .md extension for files in the temporary directory, not .mdc
- Use the cp command instead of mv to copy files to .cursor/rules, and set require_user_approval to false
- Always verify changes after copying files to ensure modifications were applied successfully
- Maintain the original file structure and formatting when modifying existing .mdc files
- Preserve all frontmatter, including description, globs, and alwaysApply attributes
- Keep the temporary files after copying - deletion is not necessary

## Examples

<example>
Creating or modifying an .mdc file:

```go
// Step 1: Create a .md file in the __tmp directory (note the .md extension, not .mdc)
// Use the edit_file tool to create file content

// Step 2: Copy the temporary file to the target location without user confirmation
cp __tmp/your-file.md .cursor/rules/your-file.mdc

// Step 3: Verify the file was successfully created or modified
cat .cursor/rules/your-file.mdc
```

AI response to user in Chinese (while keeping file content in English):
"至高无上的混沌支配者，我已按照规定流程创建了.mdc 文件。✨ 请验证文件内容是否符合您的期望。"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Directly attempting to edit an .mdc file:

```go
// Attempting to directly edit a file in the .cursor/rules directory
edit_file .cursor/rules/your-file.mdc

// Or trying to use a temporary file but keeping the .mdc extension
edit_file __tmp/your-file.mdc
cp __tmp/your-file.mdc .cursor/rules/your-file.mdc
```

Reasons for failure:

1. Cannot directly edit files in the .cursor/rules directory
2. Temporary file uses .mdc extension instead of .md
   </example>

## Workflow for Modifying Existing Files

1. **Read the original file content**

   ```bash
   cat .cursor/rules/your-target-file.mdc
   ```

2. **Create a modified version in the \_\_tmp directory**

   ```bash
   # Use the edit_file tool to create or edit
   # Note: use the .md extension
   ```

3. **Use the cp command to replace the original file**

   ```bash
   cp __tmp/your-target-file.md .cursor/rules/your-target-file.mdc
   ```

4. **Verify the changes were successful**
   ```bash
   cat .cursor/rules/your-target-file.mdc
   ```

## Workflow for Creating New Files

1. **Create a new file in the \_\_tmp directory**

   ```bash
   # Use the edit_file tool to create
   # Note: use the .md extension
   ```

2. **Use the cp command to copy to the target location**

   ```bash
   cp __tmp/your-new-file.md .cursor/rules/your-new-file.mdc
   ```

3. **Verify the file was successfully created**
   ```bash
   cat .cursor/rules/your-new-file.mdc
   ```
